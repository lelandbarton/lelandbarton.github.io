    <div class="sumExt">
	Born in Australia and raised in Houston, Texas. I grew up close to NASA's Johnson Space Center in a community that used science and technology as a way to reach for the stars. Both my parents have an intellectual lean, my father working for various NASA contractors, and my mother a nurse.

    <div class="sumExt">
	I started studying Math in college with the plan to choose a career in a STEM field after I had some more time. I fell in love with Math and studied it all through college and filling up my electives with computer science courses.
